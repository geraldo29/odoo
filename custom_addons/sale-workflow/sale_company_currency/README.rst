This module adds functional fields to show sale order in the company
currency: amount total.

1. For tree view, when you have SO in multiple currencies, Odoo sums
   them up regardless the different currencies. This module adds a
   column & sums in the company's currency.
2. The field is also shown in form view after the total.
